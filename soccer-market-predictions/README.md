## Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the market value of soccer players using data from the FIFA video game series. The research focuses on players from the top 5 European leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1) and explores how player attributes, performance metrics, and other factors influence their market valuation.

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive data analysis of 2,614 players from top European leagues
- Implementation and comparison of 7 machine learning models
- Identification of key factors influencing player market value
- Advanced feature engineering and data visualization
- Rigorous model evaluation with cross-validation

### Model Performance Comparison

| Model                      | MSE            | R² Score  |
|----------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| XGBoost                    | 1.16×10¹¹      | 0.9995    |
| Decision Tree              | 3.80×10¹¹      | 0.9983    |
| Random Forest              | 8.04×10¹²      | 0.9635    |
| Support Vector Machine     | 1.53×10¹³      | 0.9305    |
| Simple Linear Regression   | 6.09×10¹³      | 0.7239    |

## Technical Implementation

### Data Preprocessing

Key steps in preparing the FIFA dataset:

```r
# Sample from EDA.R - Handling missing values
FIFA_final_df2 <- FIFA_final_df2 %>%
  mutate(
    `Release Clause(€)` = ifelse(is.na(`Release Clause(€)`), 0, `Release Clause(€)`),
    `Contract Valid Until` = ifelse(is.na(`Contract Valid Until`), 0, `Contract Valid Until`)
  ) %>%
  drop_na(c('Club', 'Body Type', 'Real Face', 'Position'))
```

### Feature Engineering

Created new features to enhance predictive power:
- Average goals per game (from external dataset)
- General position categories (Attack, Midfield, Defense, Goalkeeper)
- Standardized skill ratings

### Machine Learning Implementation

```python
# XGBoost implementation snippet
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Initialize and train model
xgb_model = xgb.XGBRegressor(objective='reg:squarederror')
xgb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(xgb_model, X_train, y_train, cv=10, scoring='r2')
print(f"Average R²: {scores.mean():.4f} (±{scores.std():.4f})")
```

## Visualizations
